# Standard First Aid and CPR

I took up First Aid certification last summer since I found that summer jobs working with kids (which makes up most of the opportunities for students with no prior work experience) required it. I did my theory training through the Canadian Red Cross's online modules, and a one-day practical training through Coast2Coast First Aid & Aquatics. I learned some interesting facts about different ways in which the human body can break, and I feel a bit more secure knowing that I can help myself and others in a medical emergency.

My (very messy) theory notes are available here.
