# Foam board RC plane

This is a project I started planning during the winter break of 2021-2022, and worked on over last summer. I wanted to practice my design skills and apply the theoretical aerodynamics knowledge I read up on by building something that could actually fly. 

I ordered some electrical components (brushless DC motor, ESC, TX/RX, lipo batteries, servos), and manufactured the airframes and wings out of foam board ($1.50 or so per 20x30 inch sheet at Dollarama or DollarTree) covered with packing tape. I based my wing airfoil shape and production process off of Experimental Airline's Armin wing (https://youtu.be/karr67ZYho4) and made the fuselage a simple tube. 

I made the following prototypes:
* A simple glider to test out my wings (done during the winter break)
* FW28: An initial prototype of 28" wingspan (with a cardboard fuselage) that was too small for its weight. I recorded some important lessons for my future prototypes in a report.
* FW40: A prototype of 40" wingspan. This successfully flew after adding dihedral into the wing, but was very heavy and also susceptible to wind. 
* FW30: A prototype of 30" wingspan. Because it was smaller and of lighter construction, it was much more forgiving to fly, and also was less susceptible to wind.
* A sub-250g prototype with 20" wingspan and smaller electronic components. This was so I could legally fly it in a park without an advanced drone license (which is required to fly drones of more than 250g in restricted airspace--which is basically all of Toronto and the surrounding area). I didn't fly this before the end of summer since I picked an incompatible propellor and prop adapter, but I'm hoping to fix this if I get a chance to return home on a co-op term.

I registered with the MAAC (Model Aeronautics Association of Canada) and joined a local RC flying club, Humber Valley Radio Control Flyers, where I learned to fly with an instructor on my FW40 and FW30 prototypes. 

These are some of the skills I learned or practiced during this project:
* Application of aerodynamic principles to the control stability of a real plane (e.g. balancing center of gravity with center of lift)
* Soldering, to make and fix wire connections between components
* Planning parts acquisition for large projects--essential since the cheapest place for these components was HobbyKing, and they ship all the way from Hong Kong!
* Basic mechanical skills--just building stuff (if only out of foam board and wood for the most part), using hand tools, planning cutting patterns and fitting together of parts, and choosing basic components like screws

If I can get back home, I'm thinking of making more polished prototypes and (stretch goal) creating my own flight controller to implement automatic stabilization in the roll axis, which would be a nice control systems project. Otherwise, I'm thinking of making a drone instead, which would be much easier to store in my dorm. I'd like to stay under 250g so that I can legally test-fly in the city without needing to go to an MAAC field under Transport Canada drone regulations.
