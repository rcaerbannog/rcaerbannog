Packing tape (as wide as possible)--scotch packing tape? Or something similar to what I have?
3M extreme mounting tape (thin, strong)
Dollartree/Dollarama foam board
Blank gift card/ID card for polyhedral panels (CR80 30 Mil PVC Cards--available on Amazon)

Note that all planes flown without a drone certificate, or with a basic certificate in restricted airspace (including all my local parks due to Downsview and Buttonville), must be under 250g. Planes flown with a basic license under 25 kg outside of restricted airspace, or under MAAC certification under 35 kg, are OK.

Note: FT Tiny Trainer glider will be under 250g, but not with power added
A 30" foam flyer will almost certainly exceed 250g, so must be held for MAAC membership

Note that for CW props, the plane will naturally yaw left. So thrust line should be offset right a few degrees.
For CCW props, the plane will yaw right, so thrust line should be offset left.
(There are many contributions to the yaw tendency, but its direction can be determined from engine torque roll + adverse yaw)
