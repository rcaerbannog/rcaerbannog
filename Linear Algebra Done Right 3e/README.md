# Linear Algebra Done Right 3e (Axler)

These are some of my notes and problems from Axler's _Linear Algebra Done Right, Third Edition_, an excellent introduction to linear algebra. I finished the first two chapters before the end of summer and I plan to come back to this in my spare time.

Notes and problems are typeset in LaTeX! I also used it for my Honours Differential/Integral Calculus (MATH 120/121) homework last year, and am currently using it for Mathematical Proof (MATH 220). Do ask if you'd like to see some of these assignments--I haven't made them public since similar assignments will be used in the courses in future years.
