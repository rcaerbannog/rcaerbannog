OOP
Never pass the self argument into object methods; Python always passes it for you, and passing it explicitly adds another argument.
Even in objects, object attributes MUST be referred to as self.attribute

Class variables (equivalent to static variables in Java) are defined in the class body, but outside the __init__ method
Object attributes are defined in the __init__ method, as self.attribute
Static methods can be declared using the @staticmethod decorator above the definition statement
