# Python: HelloWorldBook 2nd Edition projects

These are the guided projects I wrote when going through the book _Hello World! Second Edition_ by Warren and Carter Sande, an introductory book to Python programming using the PyGame library. I went through this book in the summer of 2020 (before grade 12), which is quite a long time ago. I've shamefully not practiced my Python a great deal since, though it'd be easier to refamiliarize myself with Python with this past experience.
